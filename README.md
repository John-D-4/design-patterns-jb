## Course Description

## This course provides a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to the rapid creation and application of ontology design patterns. Students will learn to construct modular, reusable patterns and adapt them to various modeling scenarios. Topics include modularity, the distinction between simplified and complex patterns, and displaying patterns in various formats (e.g., PowerPoint, Mermaid.js). The course emphasizes heuristic-driven, practical approaches to pattern design, fostering skills that enable rapid prototyping and iteration.

## Learning Outcomes

| Outcome                                                                                                                     | Method of Assessment |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Identify key principles of modularity and reusability in ontology design patterns.                                          | Pattern 1-3, Midterm |
| Distinguish between simplified and complex patterns and decide which is appropriate for specific use cases.                 | Pattern 1-3, Midterm |
| Develop skills to present patterns effectively using tools like PowerPoint, Mermaid.js, and other visualization frameworks. | All                  |
| Use heuristic methods and best practices to design and implement ontology patterns efficiently.                             | Pattern 3,4          |
| Work collaboratively on real-world design pattern creation, receiving and providing constructive feedback.                  | All                  |
| Assess the quality and suitability of ontology design patterns in terms of modularity, expressivity, and reusability.       | Pattern 5, Final     |

## Grading Policy

| **Weighting** | **Assessment/Assignment** |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| 40%           | Submitted Patterns        |
| 30%           | Reviews of Patterns       |
| 15%           | Midterm Review            |
| 15%           | Final Pattern             |

*Design Pattern Assignments*

Five design patterns will be assigned during the course. You are
encouraged to work with your classmates on these assignments. You will
be allowed to select a domain to model. You will be evaluated based on
your ability to identify a competency question that is neither too
narrow nor too broad, then provide a design pattern that can be used to
answer it. Patterns will be due **at the beginning of class on the
Monday of the week that they are assigned** unless otherwise specified.
Patterns will be submitted to the instructor via email. **Late patterns
will not be accepted**. We will likely discuss submitted patterns in
class following the deadline, hence the strict late policy. When
calculating your final score for the course, **I will drop your lowest
scored pattern**.

*Attendance and Participation*

In my experience, attendance is vital to mastering the material covered
during this course. With that in mind, I require students attend each
class session, and incorporate this requirement into each student’s
grade. There are two components to the grade: attendance and
participation.

With respect to attendance, you are allowed to **miss two sessions**
without penalty and without an excuse.

With respect to participation, I intend to follow the rubric below:

  - 90-100% - Regularly contribute to class discussions with insightful
    and relevant comments. Engage constructively with peers.

  - 80-89% - Frequently participates in class discussions. Shows a good
    understanding of course material.

  - 70-79% - Participates in class but contributions are less frequent.
    Understands basic concepts but does not demonstrate good
    understanding of the course material.

  - 60-69% - Rarely participates in class discussions. Contributions
    show minimal understanding of the course content.

  - 0-59% - Does not participate in class discussions or contributions
    are off-topic or disruptive. Shows little to no understanding or
    engagement with the course material.

Accordingly, it will serve you well to be prepared to discuss the course
content when you arrive each day, that is, complete the assignments, and
be ready to engage in discussions.

Students may have valid reasons for missing classes, including military
duties, religious commitments, health issues verified by a physician or
qualified healthcare provider, among other things. You must inform me at
least 48 hours in advance via email, when feasible. I will determine
what constitutes a fair amount of work to compensate for your absence.

*Midterm Pattern*

The cumulative midterm evaluation will consist of the revision and
resubmission of design patterns you have created up to that point in the
course. Each student is required to complete the midterm review. The
midterm review submission will be due **at the beginning of class on the
Monday of the week that it is assigned** unless otherwise specified. The
midterm review will be submitted to the instructor via email. The
midterm review **will not be accepted after the deadline**.

*Final Pattern*

The cumulative final pattern will consist of a portfolio of design
patterns, of no fewer than three design patterns, submitted by each
student. Each student is required to complete the final pattern
assignment. Students are required to work with each other to complete
the assignment, as they will be evaluated in part based on the extent to
which the content of their design pattern portfolio complements the
portfolios of other students. Redundancy across students will count
against the grades for each. Students are encouraged to revise and
include design patterns submitted earlier in the course for their
portfolio. The final will be due **at the beginning of class on the
Monday of the week that it is assigned** unless otherwise specified. The
final will be submitted to the instructor via email. The final **will
not be accepted after the deadline**.

*Incompletes*

A grade of incomplete (“I”) indicates that additional course work is
required to fulfill the requirements of a given course. Students may
only be given an “I” grade if they have a passing average in coursework
that has been completed and have well-defined parameters to complete the
course requirements that could result in a grade better than the default
grade. An “I” grade may not be assigned to a student who did not attend
the course. Prior to the end of the semester, students must initiate the
request for an “I” grade and receive the instructor’s approval.
Assignment of an “I” grade is at the discretion of the instructor.
